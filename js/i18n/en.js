     * The `directive` list in each slideshow entries are used to control the slideshow's image and texts.
     * - `["image", x]` sets the banner image to that found in `/res/slideshow/{show id}/{x}.png/, or a
     * placeholder image if the destination image is not found.
     * - `["text", x]` plays a scrolling text at the bottom of the banner image.
     * 
     * You may add or remove text entries if if makes the translation better, 
     * but the order of image entries should stay the same.
