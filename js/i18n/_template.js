/* 

    This is a template language file if you want to translate One Trillion Free Draws
    to your language.
    
    TO ADD A LANGUAGE:
    - Copy this file,
    - Change the `code` in `i18nStrings.code` to a different one to avoid conflicts.
      This should be the ISO language code of your language.
    - Add the file to index.html for the game to register the language file: 
      <script src="js/i18n/name_of_this_file.js"></script>

    SOME THINGS TO NOTE:
    - You can call the `checkMissingStrings(code)` function in the game's developer 
      console to check for missing strings.
    - Some objects are special, such as `verbs`. Check the comments in _default.js to
      learn more about them.
    - You can use your IDE or text editor's JSDoc support to learn more about some
      special objects and to quickly find missing strings as you type.
